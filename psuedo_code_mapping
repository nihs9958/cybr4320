//
This pseudo-code creates an instance of the KMedians operator, 
which takes an input stream of data and the number of clusters (k) as inputs. 
The initialize_kmedians function initializes the set of k medians for the KMedians algorithm.
The operator is then registered with the SAM machine using the register_operator function. Once registered, 
the operator can be used to perform KMedians clustering on input data.
